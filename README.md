# editor

Advaita Editor is an opinionated open source text editor which is highly inspired by tools like Notion, Medium, Ghost and Substack. It intends to set the best experience for long form and short form writing by blending the most intuitive and powerful workflows and making them easy to use. Highly experimental. Try at your own peril.
